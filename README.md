Divide Batter: Pour the cake batter evenly into the prepared cake pans.
Bake: Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a wooden skewer inserted into the center comes out clean.
Cool in Pans: Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10-15 minutes before inverting them onto a wire rack to cool completely.
Frost & Decorate: Once the cakes are completely cool, frost with your favorite frosting and decorate as desired.
Tips & Notes:

Softened Butter: Ensure your butter is properly softened for a smooth batter.
Don't Overmix: Overmixing can lead to a tough cake. Mix until just combined.
Oven Temperature: Oven temperatures can vary. Use an oven thermometer for accuracy.
Cool Completely: Make sure the cakes are fully cooled before frosting to prevent the frosting from melting.
Variations:
Chocolate Cake: Add cocoa powder to the dry ingredients.
Flavor Extracts: Experiment with other extracts like almond or lemon.
Sprinkles/Mix-ins: Fold in sprinkles, chocolate chips, or nuts at the end.
Enjoy your homemade cake!
